"# Walloppro.github.io" 
This is just a basic website for my self that follows made following the criteria for IAT 355 Assignment 2,
and includes an index.html that has my personal introduction, my education, skills, experience, images/hobbies, and contact information. The styles.css is used for all the displayed attributes and anything that can be seen on the different html pages, the main.js file holds my interactibility which in this case is a dark mode toggle. The vis.js holds the code needed to create the SVG files that displayed on the visualizations.html page.
